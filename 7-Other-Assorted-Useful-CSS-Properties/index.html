        <h3>Relative</h3>
        <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the documento, and then offset relative to itself basded on the values of top, right, bottom and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static</p>

        <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.

    <section id="fixed">
        <h3>Fixed</h3>
        <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none, in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom and left</p>
